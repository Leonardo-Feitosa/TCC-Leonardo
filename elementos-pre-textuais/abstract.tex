The wireless technology is widely adopted around the world, from devices to infrastructure. Its success is due to the facilities that wireless brings to users, such high data transmission, access almost everywhere, mobility and ease of installation. Among wireless technologies the Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) stands out as the most popular choice for home and enterprise uses. However, in order for the Wi-Fi to work correctly and to coexist with other networks, it is important to make an initial project to ensure a good network operation. Therefore, this work presents a Wi-Fi project technique named site-survey which is applied into IFCE Campus Tau√° teaching building for both indoor and outdoor environments. With the heat maps generated by a site-survey software, it is possible to analyze the Wi-Fi signal strength in order to evaluate the current network and to propose improvements and adjustments to benefit more Wi-Fi users in terms of connection and coverage.
